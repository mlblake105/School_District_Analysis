# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
A data scientist with a city school district has assigned the following tasks to reveal performance trends and patterns.

1. Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School due to academic dishonesty
2. Complete a school district analysis to show the following metrics:
    - District summary
    - School summary
    - The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate

    - The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
